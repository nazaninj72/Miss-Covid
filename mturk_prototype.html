                                    In the next 10 tasks we are going to ask questions that are focused on ${topic}. <br>
                                    Some people believe the virus is originated in the lab and it has been released from a lab intentionally or unintentionally. There are several theories around this topic.<br>
                                    For instance one of the theories is that virus does not have natural origin and it has been developed in the lab to be used as biological weapon, another theory suggests that the virus was accidentally released from lab and etc. 
                                    Given above definition for the topic of ${topic} and provided Tweet we want you to answer following questions.
